# Heart Disease Prediction Project Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various medical conditions and features. As part of the efforts toward the **Microsoft-X Data Science Nigeria 2024 AI Bootcamp Qualification Hackathon**, this notebook explores heart disease diagnosis, leveraging machine learning techniques for improved predictive performance.

## Introduction
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early diagnosis is crucial in reducing mortality rates and improving patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods can be expensive and time-consuming, so there is a growing need for fast, cost-effective solutions. This project seeks to build a predictive model that evaluates the risk of heart disease based on readily available patient data.

The notebook walks through the steps involved in creating a model using machine learning techniques, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training and evaluation.

## Objectives
The key objectives of this project are:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: To understand and analyze the patterns, trends, and key insights in the dataset.
- **Model Building**: To build a predictive model that can accurately determine the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on selected features.
- **High Accuracy and Generalizability**: Ensure that the model can generalize well to new, unseen data and demonstrate robust accuracy metrics.

## Significance of Heart Disease Prediction
Early prediction of heart disease is critical for enabling timely interventions, improving patient care, and reducing healthcare costs. By creating an effective prediction model, healthcare professionals can:
- Optimize resource allocation for patients at high risk.
- Avoid unnecessary medical procedures.
- Improve public health planning by identifying risk factors at the population level.
- Advance research into heart disease and contribute to better health outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset contains medical data of individuals and whether they have heart disease. Key features include:
- Age
- Sex
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Blood Sugar Levels
- And more...

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling where necessary.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and relationships within the data.
3. **Model Selection**: Multiple machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.) are applied and evaluated to find the best-performing model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are computed to assess model performance.

## Challenges and Mitigations
- **Imbalanced Data**: Heart disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance. Techniques such as oversampling or Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) were considered to balance the data.
- **Overfitting**: Cross-validation and regularization techniques were implemented to prevent overfitting and ensure the model's ability to generalize to new data.

## Key Insights
- **Important Features**: The most significant predictors of heart disease include age, cholesterol levels, and resting blood pressure.
- **Platform Impact**: This model provides healthcare practitioners with a valuable tool to predict the likelihood of heart disease using basic health measurements.
